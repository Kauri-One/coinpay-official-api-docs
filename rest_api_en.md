## Request Processing
* Base api url - https://coinpay.org.ua/
* Content-Type – json

Each response contains a structure in which there is a ‘status’ field indicating if such response was processed successfully. A successfully processed response has 2XX status code, and an unsuccessfully processed one - either 4XXX or 5XX.

###### Example of a successfully processed request:

```javascript
 {"status": "success"}
```

###### Example of an unsuccessfully processed request:

```javascript
 {"status": "error", "error": <имя ошибки>}
```

There are no error codes; there is only a verbally described reason.
By default, all errors are returned in English.
It is possible to localize errors in Russian by adding the following title to the request itself – ‘Accept-Language’ with the value ‘ru’.

# Public Data
## Getting active currencies list

```javascript
 GET "/api/v1/currency"
```

###### Sample response:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "currencies": ["BTC","EUR",...]
}

```

The system returns a list of currencies active at the moment as well as the name of a currency itself, as identified in the system.

## Getting active pairs list
`` `javascript
GET "/ api / v1 / pair"
```

###### Sample response:
```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "pairs": [
    [
      {
        "currency_to_spend": "UAH",
        "currency_to_get": "BTC",
        "name": "BTC_UAH",
        "base_currency": "BTC"
      }
    ],
```

API endpoint returns a list of active pairs by which exchanges can be made.

** Explanation of a pair name: **

Usually two currencies are involved in an exchange; one of them is what someone spends, another one – what they receive.
In the current example, ‘BTC_UAH’ pair stands for buying BTC for UAH.
In order to purchase UAH for BTC, one needs to use another pair – ‘UAH_BTC’. In fact, we only have one pair; this is the direction of exchange.

## Getting prices

```javascript
 GET "api/v1/exchange_rate"
```

###### Sample response:

```javascript
{  
  "rates": [  
    {  
      "pair": "UAH_EUR",  
      "base_currency_price": 0.03800836,  
      "price": 26.31  
    }  
  ]  
}                              
																						
```

For the current API endpoint, you can get all the prices for all pairs for an exchange (ticker).


## Calculating exchange cost

```javascript
 GET "api/v1/exchange/calculate"
```

###### Parameters:

```javascript
currency_to_get - required. The currency a user receives
currency_to_spend - required. The currency a user spends
currency_to_get_amount, currency_to_spend_amount - In order to calculate, you need to specify one of the parameters, either ‘the amount of the currency one wants to receive’ or ‘the amount of the currency that a user wants to spend’
exchange_price is an optional parameter. You can specify an exchange price; if the price is not specified, market price is used.
```

###### Sample response:

```javascript
{
  "currency_to_get_amount": 1,
  "currency_to_get": "BTC",
  "currency_to_spend_amount": 202170.7475,
  "currency_to_spend": "UAH",
  "status": "success",
  "exchange_price": 202170.7475
}
```

At each calculation, a response always returns the calculated exchange (exchange price, how much will be spent, the currency, and how much will be received).

# User data
## Creating account

```javascript
  POST "api/v1/user/create"
```

###### Parameters:

```javascript
{
    "email": "string",
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string",
}                                                  

```

All the above fields are required. After API request is successfully completed, one needs to confirm their email (a mail will be sent to their email address); on can go through authorization only after confirming their email.
In the body of the mail, there is a link one needs to click to confirm their email. Link lifetime is 1 day.

## Account types
After a user has confirmed their email, their account becomes ‘NOT_VERIFIED’.
After verification, the account changes to ‘VERIFIED’.
The third account type is designated for business users (merchants) – ‘BUSINESS’.

## Authorization types
Currently, there are two types of API authorization - with JWT token and with request signature through api_key and api_secret.
Users choose the preferable authorization type themselves. We recommend using the request signature.

### JWT authorization


```javascript
POST "api/v1/user/obtain_token"
```
###### Parameters:

```javascript
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}                                              

```

###### Example of a successful response (token received):
```javascript
{
  "username": "<username>",
  "token": "<token>"
}
```

After a token has been received, one can perform requests that require authorization.
The token must be specified in the header --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token> header. Token lifetime is 15 minutes.
The token for ‘Swagger’ (through Authorize button) is specified in the same format so that it reboots and shows all available methods allowed to a user.

After the token expires, it should be ‘reobtained’ through ‘obtain token’ method.

### Authorization by request signature
After passing the verification, api_key and api_secret will be provided.
In order to use authorization by request signature, one needs to provide two headers:
```javascript
--header 'Sign: <generated_signature>' --header 'Key: <api_key>'                                          
```

###### Signature creation algorithm:
** Step 1: ** You need to sort the request parameters in alphabetical order and transform nesting in parameters, if there is any.
** Example without nesting: **
```javascript
{
  "currency": "string",
  "amount": "string"
}							
```

In this case, you should get a dictionary, but with sorted keys:
```javascript
{
  "amount": "string",
  "currency": "string"
}							
```

** Example if there is nesting: **
```javascript
{
  "currency": "string",
  "amount": "string",
  "additional_info": {"client_ip": "8.8.8.8"}
}
```

** Transforms into the following dictionary: **
{
  "currency": "string",
  "amount": "string",
  "additional_info_client_ip": "8.8.8.8"
}

The keys of the received dictionary should be sorted in alphabetical order.
** Step 2: ** A line for signature is created in this format:
```javascript
{request.method} - {request.path} - {sorted_params}
```

** Step 3: ** The api_secret string is signed using the algorithm hmac_sha_256.
Similar manipulations are to be carried out with each request.

## Getting balance

```javascript
  GET "api/v1/user/balance"
```

###### Sample response:
```javascript
{
"wallets": {
    "USDT": {
      "address": "0x85E12eA5270C8848D9258FB76de475144dBC1E3e",
      "qr_file_data": img in base64
    },
    ...
  },
  "balance": {
    "EUR": {
      "currency": "EUR",
      "EUR": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "ETH": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "UAH": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "USDT": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "USD": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "RUB": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      },
      "BTC": {
        "reserved": 0,
        "total": 0
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}                                                  

```

The balance contains crypto addresses that can be replenished; the addresses are assigned to the users. The balance itself also comes in two fields, ‘total’ and ‘reserved’. ‘Total’ stands for the total amount of funds, ‘Reserved’ – for the funds already taken and located in the orders. Using the balance, you can find out how much money is currently available in a particular currency; moreover, you can get a conversion of funds from one currency to another.

**For example:**

1) The amount of ‘EUR’ in your account - balance [‘EUR’] [‘EUR’]

2) The amount of ‘EUR’ in ‘ETH’ - balance [‘EUR’] [‘ETH’]

## Getting account settings
```javascript
  GET "api/v1/user/account_info"
```

```javascript
  {
  "name": "Свят",
  "email": "svyatoslavkravchenko@gmail.com",
  "account_type": "VERIFIED",
  "is_email_verified": true,
  "referral_id": "89f67887-cae6-4a6f-a393-a89079878a57",
  "created": "2019-02-05T08:13:48.952334",
  "is_2fa_enabled": false,
  //limits, fee, processing_rules
  }
```

A response includes a username, email address, type of account, information on whether such mail has been verified, whether two-factor authorization is enabled, as well as limits, personal funds, etc. for each order type. Each order will be considered separately
